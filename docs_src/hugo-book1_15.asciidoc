= Limit Settings

The default settings for the complete set of limits may be obtained by invoking the compiler via:

[literal, role="cmd"]
.....................
hc $list
.....................


The following limits are static and non-modifiable, since they reflect the internal configuration of the Hugo Engine:

[cols="<2m,<8d",grid=none,stripes=even]
|===============================================================================

| MAXATTRIBUTES
| The maximum number of definable attributes, not counting aliases

| MAXGLOBALS
| The maximum number of definable global variables

| MAXLOCALS
| The maximum number of local variables allowed in a routine, including arguments passed to the routine
|===============================================================================


The following are the modifiable settings, which may be set using:

[literal, role="cmd"]
......................
$<setting>=<new limit>
......................

either in the compiler's invocation line or in the source code.

[cols="<2m,<8d",grid=none,stripes=even]
|===============================================================================

| MAXALIASES
| The maximum number of aliases that may be defined for attributes and/or properties

| MAXARRAYS
| The maximum number of arrays that may be defined (not the total array space, which is automatically reserved)

| MAXCONSTANTS
| The maximum number of constants that may be defined

| MAXDICT
| The maximum number of entries that the compiler can enter into the dictionary table

| MAXDICTEXTEND
| The total number of bytes (not the total number of entries) available for dynamic dictionary extension during runtime

| MAXEVENTS
| The maximum number of global or object-linked events

| MAXFLAGS
| The maximum number of compiler flags that may be set at one time to control conditional compilation

| MAXLABELS
| The maximum number of labels that may be defined during compilation

| MAXOBJECTS
| The maximum number of objects and/or classes that may be created

| MAXPROPERTIES
| The maximum number of properties that may be defined

| MAXROUTINES
| The maximum number of standalone routines (not property routines) that may be defined
