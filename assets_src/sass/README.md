# System Requirements

This project uses [Dart Sass] to compile the CSS stylesheets, because starting from March 26, 2019 [Ruby Sass] is no longer maintained.

Since Dart Sass behavior is slightly different from Ruby Sass, anyone still working with Ruby Sass must ensure to switch to Dart Sass to avoid creating divergent CSS stylesheets.

## Installing Dart Sass

The easiest way to install Dart Sass on Windows, and keep it always updated, is to install it via [Chocolatey]/[Chocolatey GUI]:

- https://chocolatey.org/packages/sass

## Base16 Color Schemes

The Sass/CSS themes use the following Base16 color schemes:

- _Base16 Eighties_ â€” by [Chris Kempson].

The __Base16__ project was created by Chris Kempson:

The above schemes are imported via the __Base16 Sass__ project (below), which duely credits the upstream __Base16__ project in its license.

## Base16 Sass

The following Base16 SCSS files:

- [`_base16-eighties.scss`][b16 80s]
